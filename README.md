# JM_with_IFBM
This repository contains a simulated dataset with a structure similar to the NHLBI LAM registry dataset described in the paper "Joint Modeling with Integrated Fractional Brownian Motion," as well as R codes for implementing the proposed model using the IFBM process method, to generate the summaries and diagnostics.
1. "simudata.rds" is the simulation dataset.
2. "longitudinalSM_chain1.R" and "longitudinalSM_chain2.R" are the R codes for MCMC for the longitudinal sub-model.
3. Then obtain the estimates for main parameters, random effects, and stochastic process terms using the first part of the "simulation_summary.R" code. Traceplots also can be generated by using this code.
4. Next run the two chains of the survival sub-model using "survivalSM_chain1.R" and "survivalSM_chain2.R".
5. After that, obtain the parameter estimates of the survibal sub-model using second part of the "simulation_summary.R" code.
